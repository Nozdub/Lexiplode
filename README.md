# Wordblast (Working Title)

A multiplayer mobile word game that combines classic word-building mechanics (like Scrabble/Wordfeud) with strategic explosive gameplay inspired by Bomberman and Candy Crush.

## Concept
- Players build words on a shared tiled board.
- Special bomb tiles can be used as **wildcards** and trigger explosions when part of a completed word.
- Explosions clear surrounding tiles, reshuffling the board and creating new opportunities.
- The game is played over a set number of turns; the player with the highest score wins.

## Key Features (Planned)
- Online multiplayer (random match or vs. friends).
- Turn-based word placement with scoring system.
- Explosive bomb tiles introducing strategy and unpredictability.
- Leaderboards showing top 100 players.
- Player accounts with authentication.
- 100% free-to-play with no pay-to-win mechanics.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- **Engine/Framework:** (To be decided together â€” Unity, Flutter, or React Native depending on scope).
- **Backend:** Node.js / Firebase / Supabase for authentication, matchmaking, and leaderboards.
- **Database:** Likely NoSQL for fast lookup of matches & players.
- **Hosting:** Free tiers (Firebase, Supabase, or Render) to minimize costs.

## Goals
- Keep the game fully free for players.
- Build a fun, competitive experience with strategic depth.
- Launch first on Android, with iOS support later.
