# Lexiplode – High-Level Game Design One-Pager

## Core Loop
1. Each player draws 7 tiles from their personal bag.  
2. On their turn, a player places tiles to form valid words on the 15×15 board.  
3. The player scores points for the word and any multipliers.  
4. If a Catalyst (bomb) tile is used:  
   - It detonates after scoring.  
   - The detonator does not score the trigger word.  
   - All connected/linked words are destroyed; their points transfer from opponent to detonator.  
   - Destroyed tiles refill with random new ones (regular, multiplier, or Catalyst).  
   - Linked word tiles return to the detonator’s bag (trigger word tiles are lost).  
5. Game continues until the timer ends (default 5 minutes).  
6. Highest score wins (future alternative win condition: domination by emptying opponent’s bag).

## Win Conditions
- **Points Victory (default):** Highest score when match timer expires.  
- **Domination Victory (future mode):** Opponent has no tiles left to play (bag drained by detonations).  
- **Draw:** Tie on score → player with fewer unused rack tiles wins. If still tied, result is a draw.

## Match Format
- **Standard Mode:**  
  - 5-minute match timer.  
  - Approximately 30 seconds per turn (tunable after testing).  
- **Future Modes:**  
  - **Blitz:** 2–3 minutes, 15-second turns.  
  - **Casual:** No timer, play until bags are empty.  
  - **Marathon:** 10–15 minutes.

## Board and Tiles
- **Board:** 15×15 grid.  
- **Templates:** Start from 5–10 predefined, balanced layouts. Each template mixes:  
  - ~70% Regular tiles  
  - ~25% multipliers (x2/x3 letter/word)  
  - ~5% Catalyst tiles  
- **Distribution:** Template chosen randomly at match start.  
- **Bag:** Each player begins with 7 tiles (adjustable 6–9 during testing).

## Catalyst (Bomb) Mechanic
- Counts as any chosen letter.  
- After word is placed, detonates:  
  - Trigger word is destroyed (tiles lost, no score for detonator).  
  - Linked words’ points transfer from opponent to detonator.  
  - Linked word tiles are returned to detonator’s bag.  
  - Board squares are repopulated with new random tiles.

## Anti-Frustration Systems
- **Vowel/Consonant Balance:** Bags ensure a weighted ratio so players are not starved of vowels.  
- **Turn Timer:** Prevents stalling but leaves enough time for strategic thinking.  
- **Random Board Refresh:** Keeps play dynamic after detonations, avoiding stale states.  

---

## Notes and Open Questions
- Should Catalyst frequency be fixed (X per template) or percentage-based?  
- Balance testing needed: how often detonations swing games compared to standard play.  
- Need to finalize dictionary choice (language and word list).
